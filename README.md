# modelmemz

A lightweight CLI chat tool that lets you swap between Groq-hosted LLMs while keeping a short-term memory of the conversation.

## What it does
1. Stores all messages in `chat_history.json`.
2. Replays the last *N* turns (default 8) to whichever model you choose, so each model sees the same context.
3. Lets you switch models by typing a letter (A-F).
4. Uses Groqâ€™s Chat Completion API under the hood.
